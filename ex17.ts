// Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner,
// and you have space for only two guests.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that
// you can invite only two people for dinner.
// • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list.
// Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know 
// you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
// • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list,
// letting them know they’re still invited.
// • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. 
// Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.


// let guestList: string [] = ["saba", "saira", "anu"];
// let message = " unfortunately, i can invite only two people";
// console.log(guestList)
// console.log(message);

// guestList.pop();
// console.log(guestList);

// while(guestList.length > 2){

//     let removedGuest : string | undefined = guestList.pop();
//     if (removedGuest !== undefined){
//         console.log(`Sorry ${removedGuest}, we can not invite you`);
//     }
// };

// // • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list

// guestList.forEach(guest => {
//     console.log(` Dear ${guest}, ur still invited for dinner`);
// });


// // • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list

// guestList.splice(0,2)
// console.log(guestList);
